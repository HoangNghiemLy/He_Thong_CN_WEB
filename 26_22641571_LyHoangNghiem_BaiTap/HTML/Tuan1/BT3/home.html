            <span>Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span> After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances. <br> <br>

            I've started putting up a <a href="./slide1.html" >slide show</a>  of the production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me. <br> <br>

            Once again: <i>BRAVO!!!</i> -- Mrs. Juroszek
